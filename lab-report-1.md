## **Basic Filesystem Commands Learned About**
`cd` --- Using the command with no arguments:
```
marit@doofenshmirtz MINGW64 ~ $ cd
marit@doofenshmirtz MINGW64 ~
```
This output is not an error. I called `cd` while in `/c/Users/marit`. Calling `cd` without any arguments means that you will not move into a different file. This means I was still in `/c/Users/marit` after calling the `cd` command with no arguments.

Using the command with a path to a directory as an argument:
```
marit@doofenshmirtz MINGW64 ~ $ cd lecture1/
marit@doofenshmirtz MINGW64 ~/lecture1 (main) $
```
* This output is not an error. I called `cd lecture1/` while in `/c/Users/marit`. I successfully moved to the `lecture1` file.
